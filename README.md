## Open Source Code Package

Video Optimizer allows mobile application developers to test the network performance of video, images and other files for compression, speed, battery drain and other aspects of performance.

The Data Collector is the component of the Video Optimizer application that captures the data traffic of a mobile device and stores that information in trace files that can be analyzed using the Video Optimizer Data Analyzer.

The Video Optimizer Data Analyzer is the component of the Video Optimizer application that evaluates the trace data collected from an application and generates statistical and analytical results based on recommended best practices.

This Open Source Code Package contains all of the code needed to build both of these Video Optimizer components.
