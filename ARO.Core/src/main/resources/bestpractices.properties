connections.screenRotation.title=Connections: Inefficient Connections - Screen Rotation
connections.screenRotation.detailedTitle=Inefficient Connections - Screen Rotation
connections.screenRotation.desc=This test tracks screen rotation, to see if the app is pinging the server on orientation changes, or actually completely retransmit content. If you see this in your trace - consider a new layout for existing content (rather than re-download) or sending the orientation change later as a part of a larger data transmission.
connections.screenRotation.results=After rotating the screen, we detected a network traffic&nbsp;<a href="#">burst</a>. Consider reusing the content you have already downloaded in the previous layout, rather than downloading again.
connections.screenRotation.pass=Either no screen rotations were noted or the screen rotations did not trigger network activity.

connections.connClosing.title=Connections: Inefficient Connections - Connection Closing Problems
connections.connClosing.detailedTitle=Inefficient Connections - Connection Closing Problems
connections.connClosing.desc=This test checks that connections are closed promptly. If not effectively closed with the last data, the server timeout can turn the radio on just to close your connections, which wastes power and bandwidth.

connections.multiSimultaneous.title=Connections: Multiple Simultaneous Connections to Many Endpoints
connections.multiSimultaneous.detailedTitle=Multiple Simultaneous Connections to Many Endpoints
connections.multiSimultaneous.desc=Opening many connections all at once can cause bottlenecks in slower network conditions.  Android limits the number of TCP connections to 15, and if you are opening that many connections, you must ensure that the customer facing data loads first.
connections.multiSimultaneous.results=In this trace, Video Optimizer detected 12 or more connections open at the same time.  With so many connections open, you might be limiting throughput of files, or even completely preventing files from being downloaded altogether.   Ensure that these connections are not blocking critical files for the end user, or that these connections close quickly to allow for other needed connections to be established.
connections.multiSimultaneous.pass=In this trace, we do not see 12 or more connections in use at the same time.
