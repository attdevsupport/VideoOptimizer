## Open Source Code Package

Video Optimizer allows mobile application developers to test the network performance of video, images and other files for compression, speed, battery drain and other aspects of performance.

The Data Collector is the component of the Video Optimizer application that captures the data traffic of a mobile device and stores that information in trace files that can be analyzed using the Video Optimizer Data Analyzer.

The Video Optimizer Data Analyzer is the component of the Video Optimizer application that evalu  ates the trace data collected from an application and generates statistical and analytical results based on recommended best practices.

This Open Source Code Package contains all of the code needed to build both of these Video Optimizer components.

**Video Optimizer 4.5 New Features**
- New graph options for viewing Upload or Download throughput separately or singly in the diagnostics tab.

- Video Optimizer is now able to convert a folder containing a pcap file and a video file into a trace folder and synchronize the two filesâ€™ timelines. It can also covert just a pcap file alone into a trace folder with no video.

- Filter options have been added to Time Range Analysis to allow for IPv4, IPv6, TCP, UDP and DNS filtering. The statistics button will display results based on selected filters. Reanalysis will be done based on selected filters.

- Open recent menu item will display recently opened PCAP file information in addition to recent traces opened.

- Open PCAP file menu item will remember the location of the last PCAP file opened.

- Network type (5G Sub-6/5G mmWave/Advanced pro LTE/LTE/WiFi) is displayed across all applicable tabs and in the diagnostics graph. 

- Re-organized summary panel on the best practices tab makes better use of available space.

- DNS and UDP packet information is displayed when the user hovers over the packet info.

- ARO secure certificate will be visible to the user for Samsung devices.


**Known issues in Release 4.5**

- After a trace video file has been played all the way to the end in VO, the video position scroll bar cannot be clicked until video playback is started again using the Play button. Additionally, subsequent video playback might not start from the beginning of the video. However, the workaround is to use the video position scroll bar and scroll back to the beginning.
